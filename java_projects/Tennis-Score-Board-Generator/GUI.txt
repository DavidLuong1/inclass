b) Controls used:      
      (1). JMenu - contains submenu 'Exit' for closing the program easily. (**Required)
      
      (2). JRadioButtons - contains selections for the championship-match year.
           JButton - the 'reset' button takes the user back to the current year result.
        
      (3). Tool Tip (setToolTipText()) - displays info. about what each radio button does when hovered on.
      
      (4). JComboBox - changes the color/background color of the frame's header.
   
   
c) (Optional): what the program would have been if it didn't go to the dark side?
      
      It'd look more realistic, and I would have attempted to set the scores for each year's championship 
      match, more dynamically.      


d) Short Description of how to navigate and use the program:
      
      My GUI is intended to be a score-data keeper for the U.S. Open Men's Singles Championship matches 
      since 2010. 
      
      To view the match results of a particular year, the user would click on a desired year(indicated by 
      JRadioButtons), then the current result on the scoreboard will change to the result during the selected
      year. Of course, the user can reset the scoreboard to the current(this year's) result by pressing the 
      'Reset to Default' button.
      
      The GUI also allows exiting from the 'File' menu, and displays its info. within the 'Help' section.
      Last, the user is capable of changing the header color/background for better view (NOT RECOMMENDED,
      because this program is meant to be "Evil").
            

e) What makes your program the most evil?
       Having a button disappear, intentionally, and choosing a mix of colors: both dark colors
       and color-blinded ones.

f) How to easily exit the program?
       Clicking the 'x' icon on the top corner of the JFrame, or by locating (File > Exit) then 
       clicking 'Exit'.
